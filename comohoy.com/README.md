### comohoy.com filters and scripts:

Go to UBO's "Advanced settings" by clicking the cogwheel icons next to the "I am an advanced user" checkbox.
If the `userResourcesLocation` is unset, set it to the following URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lavafroth/ublockFilters/main/comohoy.com/comohoy.js
```

If the value is already set, add a space and then the URL.

Under the "Filter lists" tab, scroll all the way down, check `import` and add the following URL.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lavafroth/ublockFilters/main/comohoy.com/filters.txt
```

You should now see direct links instead of redirects on respective.
